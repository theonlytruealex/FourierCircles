Some of the images were sourced from: http://www.freepik.com

This was inspired by 3b1b's video on Fourier series. It works by finding the coefficients for
a chosen number of vectors, then using them to draw the image.

To use it, add images to the images folder and set the svg_file variavle to ./images/new_name.svg.
***There needs to be octave installed for this program to work!***
